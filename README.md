In this section, the codes related to the implementation of Graph Neural Networks using PyTorch are provided. It includes simple educational examples as well as more complex networks applied to various tasks, accompanied by some relevant documentation. In part of the files, considering the computational cost issues of Graph Neural Networks, efforts will be made to adopt techniques that reduce computational costs while maintaining an appropriate level of accuracy.
